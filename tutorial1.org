**** 1. Brown, Jones and Smith are suspected of income tax evasion. They testify under oath as follows:

      Brown: Jones is guilty and Smith is innocent.
      Jones: If Brown is guilty, then so is Smith.
      Smith: Im innocent, but at least one of the others is guilty.

**** Assuming everyones testimony is true, who is innocent and who is guilty?

***** answer:

     A = Jones Guilty
     B = Smith Guilty
     C = Brown Guilty

     (A ∧ ¬B)
     | A B | A | ∧ | ¬B |

     B = 0 false
     C = 0 false

     Jones = Guilty

     Brown = Innocent

**** 2. What is the truth-value of the formula (A∧C)∨((¬B∧C) → ¬A) for A = 1, B = 1, C = 0?

     | A B C | (A | ∧ | C) | ∨ | ((¬B | ∧ | C) | → | ¬A) |
     |-------+----+---+----+---+------+---+----+---+-----|
     | 1 1 0 |    | 0 |    | 1 |    0 | 0 |    | 1 |   0 |

     0 ∨ 1 = 1

**** 3. Construct the truth-table for the formula A ∨ (B ∧ C).

     | A B C | A | ∨ | (B | ∧ | C) |
     |-------+---+---+----+---+----|
     | 0 0 0 |   | 0 |    | 0 |    |

**** 5. Determine whether the formulas A ∧ (B ⊕ C) and (A ∧ B) ⊕ (A ∧ C) are equivalent,
     where ⊕ denotes ‘exclusive OR’ (or ‘XOR’).

     | A B C | A | ∧ | (B | ⊕ | C) |
     |-------+---+---+----+---+----|
     | 0 0 0 |   | 0 |    | 0 |    |

     | 0 1 1 |   | 0 |    | 0 |    |
     | 1 1 0 |   | 1 |    | 1 |    |
     | 1 0 1 |   | 1 |    | 1 |    |
     | 1 1 1 |   | 0 |    | 0 |    |

     | A B C | (A | ∧ | B) | ⊕ | (A | ∧ | C) |
     |-------+----+---+----+---+----+---+----|
     | 0 0 0 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    |
     | 0 0 1 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    |
     | 0 1 0 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    |

     | 0 1 1 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    | 0 |    |
     | 1 1 0 |    | 1 |    | 1 |    | 0 |    |
     | 1 0 1 |    | 0 |    | 1 |    | 1 |    |
     | 1 1 1 |    | 1 |    | 0 |    | 1 |    |

     Yes they are equivalent.
